# The Reason I Started Writing

If you read my posts going forward I think that you’ll quickly arrive to the conclusion that the things I write and the way I write them is the projection of my thoughts dictated by my experience, and as such it should be treated that way ‘my thoughts’, as I’m not in the possession of absolute knowledge and that my experience is something that is shaped through my daily activities, they are open to debate and discussions that I will happily have.

Now as an introduction I’d like to write about the reasons and the expectations that led me to start writing, that’s mostly intended for me to have some kind of reminder of what are the objectives and to not deviate too far from those objectives.

# The Reasons

## I like to write

I think that everyone, whether they know it or not, have some activities that makes them feel good to some extent.

It might be something like ‘reading books’, ‘playing video games’, ‘having discussions’, ‘solving puzzles’ or ‘discovering new places’, there are so many activities out there that it’s understandable that so many people struggle to find something that they like to do.

For me personally, one of those activities is that I like to write, it’s something that I discovered quite late as I had no real ‘opportunities’ to dive into this subject, but at some point in my life something made me try, and by trying it made me discover a new hobby. I’m not gonna pretend I’m exceptionally good at it, nobody is exceptionally good at anything at first, but it’s the first reason that led me here, I like to write and I’m trying to be better at it every time I do it.

## It helps me synthesise

My thoughts are often messy at first, they need to be ‘refined’ before being acted upon to avoid taking hasty decisions or having wrong assumptions, this needs research and reflection. One thing that helped me with that is writing, this is the ‘something’ that got me started at first, I wanted to try and got hooked up by this feeling of finally being able to organise my thoughts.

Once I wrote them and ‘refined’ them, I’m able to take a step back, make the connections and see the bigger picture. And that bigger picture that gets drawn remains longer in my head than the ‘raw’ thoughts that comes by.

## I like to share my knowledge

I had the occasion to teach a few times to a class of people looking to change their own career. I have to say that I’m not the most comfortable person at public speaking but I enjoyed that experience a lot due to two facts, it helped me be more comfortable in such situations and helping others brings me satisfaction.

So one of the objectives of the work I’ll be doing here will be to share my knowledge as best as I can in the hope that it could help others, and as I said previously, I’m not in the possession of absolute knowledge, so I hope to learn from the conversations that could spark from all of this.

## I’m working on a game

I started working on a game with my best friend one year ago, I remember at the start of this project, the hours we spent every weekend talking about what the game would be, what the experience would feel like, shaping the overall gameplay loop. We were also realising how much work such a project would require, this was our first experience in that specific area, we had a lot to learn and a lot to do.

Now that we are one year in that project, I feel like it’s time to talk a bit about it for two main reasons: It could help and maybe inspire others hesitating to start working on a game of their own, and I know that in an ocean full of games if we do not talk about our game, people won’t just magically know about it.

# The Expectations

Now that we went through the main reasons that got me to write, I’d like to describe the expectations that I have for this blog specifically.

## Help & Inspire

I’m not gonna pretend I’m some kind of guru, I’m not and I still have a lot to learn, and I’m not gonna try to sell some online courses. I’m gonna go so far as to say that you don’t need those courses most of the time.
Now that I got this out of the way, I still think that I have things to share, I know what it is to be in the position where you see the mountains of things to learn and to do, I know the doubts that anyone could feel at that point, as a matter of fact I’m still walking on those mountains and will probably be for a long time, but if I can help anyone or inspire anyone walking on the same path as mine, this would be good enough for me.

## Start the marketing journey

And I’m not gonna pretend that I’m only doing this to help others, I’m also doing this because I’m looking into some ways to start spreading the word about the game I’m working on, and I hope that talking about it here will bring at least some attention on it. This of course is only a first small step on the marketing journey of this project, but it still is a step and it’s good enough for me. Then maybe one day I’ll be writing about the whole marketing journey here for those who might be interested.

# Frequency

I won’t commit to a specific rule as it takes me quite some time to write, and I prefer writing things that I’m proud of than trying to get out as many posts as possible, my nights and my weekends are often taken by the game I work on and by my family so it leaves me with very narrow windows for writing, having all that in mind I’ll only say that I’ll try to have one post out every 1-2 months.
